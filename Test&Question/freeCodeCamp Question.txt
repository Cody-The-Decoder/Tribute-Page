Front-end Sticky Title Bar conundrum:

Hey guys, having a bit of a problem trying to make a sticky title for the tribute page, and as well leading into a bigger question 
about css conflicts and how to avoid them.



In the attempt to make my h1 title sticky, I had taken the instructions from w3schools (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_navbar_sticky.asp)
and applied it to the approprite div (h1 id="Title"). After trying it, the Javascript didn't seem to be applied. I noticed through the google dev
tools that when the ".sticky" class is applied, the new class declarations were cancelled out. I presume this is because of the previous delcarations 
on the h1 div, which take priority over the ".sticky" class added by the Script.

Is there any specific way of avoiding this conflict in the CSS when adding classes with Javascript? Or am I thinking about this whole thing wrong, and there's
something else I should be doing to achieve this effect, thanks.
